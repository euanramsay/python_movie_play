# Film Trailers

This program displays a screen showing the poster and title of my favorite movies. The user can click on the movie to watch the trailer.

## Running the program

The program is started by running entertainment_centre.py

## Editing film list

The list of films displayed can be easliy changed by editing the array `films` within entertainment_centre.py

All information relating to the films is dynamically created by making requests to the OMBd API and YouTube API based on the film titles in the `films` array.
